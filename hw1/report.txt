3. After running step 2, we noticed that the program threw 2 exceptions "Exception in thread server: error: 
[Errno 98] Address already in use" The server and client sockets are created but there are errors 
because the address is already in use so the connection is refused.
There is likely a timeout period where the connection cannot be reused
because of Threads?
[S]: Server socket created
[C]: Client socket created
Done.
Exception in thread server:
